        ## üîç WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR HEALTH? (DETAILED EXPLANATION)

        
        ### **HEALTH PROBLEMS FOUND:**

        [For each condition/abnormality, explain:]

        **Problem 1: [Name in simple terms, e.g., "High Blood Sugar" instead of "Hyperglycemia"]**

        **What is this?**
        - Explain in everyday language what this condition means
        - Use comparisons to things people understand (like "your blood is like soup that's too thick")
        - Avoid medical terms, or if used, immediately explain them in simple words

        **How does this affect your body?**
        - Describe step-by-step what happens inside your body
        - Explain which parts of your body are affected and how
        - Use simple analogies (like "your heart works like a pump")
        - Describe any symptoms this might cause

        **Why did this happen?**
        - Explain the most common reasons this occurs
        - Use simple cause-and-effect explanations
        - Relate to lifestyle, age, genetics, or other easy-to-understand factors

        **What do your test numbers mean?**
        - Compare your numbers to what's normal (e.g., "Normal is 80-100, yours is 150")
        - Explain if this is slightly high, very high, or extremely high
        - Use simple comparisons ("This is like having 3 teaspoons of sugar in your blood when you should only have 2")

        **Is this serious?**
        - Clearly state if this is minor, moderate, or serious
        - Explain what could happen if not treated
        - Use simple terms about risks

        **Problem 2: [If more problems exist]**
        [Same detailed, simple explanation for each additional problem]

        ### **HOW ARE THESE PROBLEMS CONNECTED?**
        - Explain in simple terms how different health issues might be related
        - Use easy examples of how one problem can cause another
        - Help the person understand the "big picture" of their health

        ### **WHAT DO YOUR TEST RESULTS MEAN?**
        [For any lab values or test results:]
        - **Your number vs. Normal number**: Clear comparison in simple terms
        - **What this means**: Explain without medical jargon
        - **Is this good or bad?**: Direct, honest assessment
        - **How much off from normal?**: Use percentages or simple comparisons

        ## ‚ö†Ô∏è HOW SERIOUS IS THIS?
        **Level**: [Normal/Mild/Moderate/Severe]
        **In Simple Terms**: [Explain severity using everyday language - e.g., "This is like having a warning light on your car dashboard - not an emergency, but needs attention soon"]

        ## üè• WHICH DOCTOR TO SEE
        **Type of Doctor**: [Specialist name]
        **Why This Doctor**: [Simple explanation of what this doctor specializes in]
        **How Soon**: [Urgent/Soon/Routine - with simple explanation]

        ## ü•ó FOODS THAT HELP OR HURT
        **Foods That Will Help You**:
        - [List with simple explanations of why each food helps]

        **Foods to Avoid**:
        - [List with simple explanations of why each food is harmful]

        **Easy Diet Tips**: [Simple, practical advice]

        ## üõ°Ô∏è THINGS TO DO AND AVOID
        **Important Things to Do Right Now**:
        - [Simple, actionable steps]

        **Changes to Make in Daily Life**:
        - [Easy-to-understand lifestyle changes]

        **Activities to Be Careful With**:
        - [Clear activity guidelines]

        ## üíä TREATMENT - WHAT TO EXPECT
        [Explain treatments in simple terms - what they do, how they work, what to expect]

        ## üìÖ FOLLOW-UP - WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
        [Simple timeline of what needs to be done and when]

        ## ‚öïÔ∏è IMPORTANT REMINDER
        This explanation is to help you understand your health better, but you must still see a real doctor. They know your full medical history and can give you proper treatment. Don't make medical decisions based only on this analysis.
